laser-exhaust-mon
-----------------

A device to monitor the pressures inside the laser exhaust filter
box to determine when the filters need changing.

This runs on a ESP8266-03 module. It communicates with two BMP180
digital pressure/temperature sensors, and sends the data to our
MQTT broker.

Programming this device is done using the 6-pin FTDI header on the
device. The USB jack is just for power.

The sensors are connected to the controller with an RJ-45 connector
(not ethernet!!). The pinout is:

RJ45 PIN    COLOR       ESP PIN         FUNCTION
--------    --------    --------        --------
1           w/or                        GND
2           or                          +3.3v
3           w/bl                        GND
4           bl                          +3.3v
5           w/gn        0               SDA (sensor 1)
6           gn          2               SCL (sensor 1)
7           w/br        13              SDA (sensor 2)
8           br          12              SCL (sensor 2)
